# Reverse Engineering Cache Block Size

Each point represents the measured load latency for a single byte access. Low-latency points correspond to vector cache hits, while high-latency spikes indicate compulsory misses served by MALL. Because the array is not cache-line aligned, the first miss occurs at Access ID 0 and the next at Access ID 121; subsequent misses occur at a constant stride of 128 accesses. The fixed spacing between miss events reveals a cache block size of 128 bytes.
